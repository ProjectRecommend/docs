# Project Recommend

## Intro
##### This application will use your offline music collection for suggesting music similar to your choices and also from online music database of  Musicbrainz.org.

## Motivation
- From our personal experience and survey that we did, we came to know that people would like to discover
new music similar to they have in their music library.
- We were unable to find any such music player that recommends songs from your offline music library based on the song that you are currently listening.
- It often happens that while listening to music, we are unable to find a song similar to the presently playing song from our personal library.
- All other services that recommend music, a majority of them were online services and to meet your sole purpose of getting good and overall  music recommendations, you had to pay.
- Sometimes, when internet bandwidth was a limitation, online music services didn't seem to be the best choice.
- Their recommendations were limited to songs or albums they had on their system.
Your offline music library didn't have any role in recommendations
