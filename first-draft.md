# Project Recommend

## Intro
##### This application will take your offline music collection and will suggest you songs from your offline collection and also from online music database from Musicbrainz.org.

## Motivation
- From our personal experience and survey that we did, we came to know that people would like to discover
new music similar to they have in their music library.
- We were unable to find any such music player that recommends songs from your offline music library based on song you currently listening.
- we also like to discover similar music that is not in your offline music library.
- All other services that recommends music, majority of them were online services and you have to listen or buy music from them only to get good overall recommendations.
- Sometimes where internet bandwidth is a limitation online music services didn't seem to be the best choice.
- Their recommendations were limited to songs or albums they have on their system.
your offline music library doesn't have any role in recommendations
