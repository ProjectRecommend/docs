# Project Recommend

## Introduction
##### This application will use your offline music collection for suggesting music similar to your choices and also from online music database of Musicbrainz.org.

## Motivation
- From our personal experience and survey that we did, we came to know that people like to discover
new music similar to what they have in their music library already.
- We were unable to find any such music player that recommends songs from your offline music library based on the song that you are currently listening.
- It often happens that while listening to music, we are unable to find a song similar to the presently playing song from our personal library.
- A majority of the other services that recommend music, are online and in order to meet your sole purpose of getting good and overall music recommendations, you have to pay.
- Sometimes, when internet bandwidth is a limitation, online music services don't seem to be the best choice.
- Their recommendations are limited to songs or albums they have on their system.
Your offline music library don't have any role in recommendations
