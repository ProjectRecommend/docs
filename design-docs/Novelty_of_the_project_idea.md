Offline Music Recommendation is an area of application development that is yet to be fully explored as there have not been enough attempts to develop a software to fulfil this need. One may get enough music recommenders online, but that is the real catch here, they are mostly **online**. Our open source software, _Music Recommendation System_ is a music player that provides a personalized service of music recommendation.

The novelty in the idea is that it recommends both from your offline collection as well as online pool. It is not a platform or service specific and not at all bounded with any music provider services so it's suggestions are not limited to some particular service.

**Have you ever used a music player that recommends songs from your offline collection?**

Just imagine the scenario where you have lots and lots of music offline. So, while listening to one of the songs, you obviously will not like yo manually choose a song from such a large collection that suits both your taste and mood. This software is a solution to this.

And if you have a stable internet connection(even with low bandwidth, like 2G), you'll get suggestions from the online pool too.Obviously, you cannot download on 2G!In this way you'll be able to explore new music too and hence downlaod when on a faster internet connection.

So this software covers both aspects, that is what is **other than usual** about it.
