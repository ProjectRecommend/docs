Offline Music Recommendation is an area of application development that is yet to be fully explored as there has not been enough attempts to develop a software to fulfil this need. One may get enough music recommenders online, but that is the real catch here, they are mostly **online**. Our open source software, _Music Recommendation System_ is a music player that provides a personalized service of music recommendation.

The novelty in the idea is that it recommends both from your offline collection as well as online pool. It is not a platform or service specific and not at all bounded with any music provider services so it's suggestions are not limited to particular service.

**Have you ever used a music player that recommends songs from your offline collection?**

Just imagine the scenario where you have lots and lots of music offline. So, while listening to one of them, you obviously don't want to choose the next song you want to listen from that huge collection. This software is a solution that will provide suggestions from your offline collection based on what you are listening.

And if you have Internet, you'll get suggestions from the online pool too. In this way you'll be able to explore new music too.

So this software covers both aspects, that is what is other than usual about this software.
