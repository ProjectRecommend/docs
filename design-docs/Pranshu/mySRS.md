### 1.0. **Introduction**

#### 1.1. *Purpose*

<p>The purpose of this SRS document is to provide a detailed description of this project.  This information includes its features, interfaces, working etc. This will also explain the overall purpose of this project in a detailed yet precise manner. This document can be used by both the *developers* and *users* of this software.</p>     

#### *Document Conventions*

<p> </p>


#### *Intended Audience And Reading Suggestions*

<p> The audience of this software could be anyone who wants music recommendations while listening music. And this document can be referred to by its writers, testers, users, developers. </p>

#### *Product Scope*

<p> This software is designed in such a way, that it will improve the user experience drastically, as the music of his choice will be automatically queued up in his current playlist, depending on his taste in music, or the kind of music he has been listening to recently. The software after being installed will automatically update the metadata(song artist, genre of the song, album etc.) of the music in his offline music library, in a very short period of time, which otherwise had to be updated manually. After updating the metadata the software will start its work of recommendation. Hence, it will sufficiently enhance the productivity/efficiency of a normal music player, along with being easy to use and maintain.</p>

<p> The scope of this software basically covers every user, who doesn't want to update the metadata of the songs in his offline music library, who doesn't want to decide manually which track to play next, who believes in listening to some random music similar to his taste. </p>
