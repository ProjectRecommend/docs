# Software Requirements Specification

##### Approved Version 1.0
<< Annotated Version >><br>

##  <b>Project Recommend</b>
(An offline/online music recommendation system)
<br>

### <i>Prepared by :</i> <u>Pranshu Sahijwani<u>

<p>Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of our course <br> <i>CS301 Software Engineering</i>.</p>




### 1.0. <b>Introduction</b>

#### 1.1. <i>Purpose</i>

<p>The purpose of this SRS document is to provide a detailed description of this project.  This information includes its features, interfaces, working etc. This will also explain the overall purpose of this project in a detailed yet precise manner. This document can be used by both the <i>developers</i> and <i>users</i> of this software.</p>     

#### 1.2. <i>Document Conventions</i>

<p>Anything written within these doubly square brackets is wonâ€™t be a part of this SRS, but will be used to inrease the readability of the person reading this, and also will provide a better explanation of the point being made. </p>


#### 1.3. <i>Intended Audience And Reading Suggestions</i>

<p> The audience of this software could be anyone who wants music recommendations while listening music. And this document can be referred to by its writers, testers, users, developers. </p>

#### 1.4. <i>Product Scope</i>

<p> This software is designed in such a way, that it will improve the user experience drastically, as the music of his choice will be automatically queued up in his current playlist, depending on his taste in music, or the kind of music he has been listening to recently. The software after being installed will automatically update the metadata(song artist, genre of the song, album etc.) of the music in his offline music library, in a very short period of time, which otherwise had to be updated manually. After updating the metadata the software will start its work of recommendation. Hence, it will sufficiently enhance the productivity/efficiency of a normal music player, along with being easy to use and maintain.</p>

<p> The scope of this software basically covers every user, who doesn't want to update the metadata of the songs in his offline music library, who doesn't want to decide manually which track to play next, who believes in listening to some random music similar to his taste. </p>

Rajdeep :product scope does not cover the user base of the product. product scope the extent this product is going to deliver and why would users prefer to use this product in its field

### 2.0 <b>Overall Description</b>
#### 2.1. <i>Product Perspective</i>
<p> India currently is a country where the internet speed is not up to the mark at many places, with only 2g spectrum, covering most of the regions. The recommendation systems that exist already recommend music, but that has to be played online, and these require a decent internet speed to play a particular song at decent bitrate, which is many a times not possible with 2g data speed. So, our idea is, basically, to use the offline music  of a user, to play music. Of course, 2g network can be used to recommend songs(fetching those from Musicbrainz API, in our case), but those songs will be played from the user's local music collection, hence minimizing the need of using 2g data in order to play music, of decent quality.
Sometimes, it might happen the ID3 tags of a few songs are not updated. One part of our software (metadata updater), will update the metadata of the songs whose metadata is not fully updated or does not exist.
This was the context of our software. This will replace those systems that are solely dependent on reliable internet speed, and will provide the benefit of music recommendations to those, who are bound in the regions covered under 2g/GPRS spectrums.
 </p>

 #### 2.2. <i>Product Functions</i>
 The basic functions of this offline music recommender system can be summarized under:
 <ul>
<li>Automatically updating <u>ID3 tags</u> of existing music existing on local storage.</li>
<li> Recommending songs based on the music taste of the user.</li>

</ul>

Rajdeep:
This product has nothing to do with bandwidth of the internet since we are not providing any download service for songs that we are suggesting. So essentially grounds of efficient bandwidth utilization has cannot be covered in the product perspective. product functions seems okay.

Rajdeep: Operating Environment looks okay.


#### 2.5. <i>Design and Implementation Constraints</i>

<ol>
<li><u> Waveform Analysis</u></li>
<p>
This is one of the methods we could have used to classify music. In this method, we analyze and classify the music wave into genres such as pop, jazz etc., but there is not enough training data available to analyze the waveform. Also there is not enough research done in this field. Hence, this method could not be used in our case.
</p>

<li><u>Collaborative Filtering</u></li>
<p>
Here, in this method, we use user data to recommend next set of songs to the user. But, due to lack of time and resources we do not have enough user data to make this method feasible to use. If we did have the user data, that data would have been used by the training model to recommend new songs based on that data.
</p>

<li><u>Availability of other basic requirements</u></li>
<p>
Since, internet is one of the basic requirements for our software to work, availability of a reliable data connection is must, does not matter if it is fast or even as slow as 2g. Lack of internet means that our recommender will work like a plain music player, which has little to no use.
</p>
<p>
Some amount of memory space will always be required to store offline music. This software will give a choice to download those songs after recommending, if those are not already in his offline library, but, since user has little to no space to store the songs offline, he won't be able to download those new songs. Therefore, this software is not suitable for such a user.

Rajdeep: Design and Implementation constraints is alright.
good job there.
