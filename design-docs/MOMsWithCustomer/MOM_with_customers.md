## Purpose
This document has a set of reports, each describing a meeting with a meeting with a particular set of customers(and not the team members). We have had meetings with a group of potential customers thrice during the course of our project.

**First**, where we told the customers about the idea before starting anything related to the software. [Click to see the report]()


 **Second**, during the building of our software, we asked the customers if they are satisfied with what was being built and whether they wanted something to be added or modified. [Click to see the report]()

 **Third**, the post completion period, where we were done with the software and wanted opinions and reviews of customers.  [Click to see the report]()
