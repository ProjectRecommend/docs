## Purpose

This document has a set of reports, each describing a meeting with a meeting 
with a particular set of customers(and not the team members). We have had meetings
with a group of potential customers thrice during the course of our project.

**First**, where we told the customers about the idea before starting anything related to the software.

**Second**, during the building of our software, we asked the customers if they are
    satisfied with what was being built and whether they wanted something to be added or modified.

**Third**, the post completion period, where we were done with the software and wanted 
    opinions and reviews of customers.
