**Music lovers with lots of offline music and no internet connection -** If you have got lots of offline music in your computer, and you choose songs manually from a folder there, since you don't have any internet connection or don't want to go online, then you will choose this software. You will simply add music (with metadata updated) to the playlist of the player and this software will automatically recommend you songs similar to what you are listening. You will get a network error in online recommendation section.

"Phew! Now no need to **choose** songs from my massive collection!"

**Music lovers with no offline music data as such and but internet connection available -** Those who go online in search of music are the ones who like to explore new music and they simply don't download music to their computer.

Addressing these guys, you can add whatever small collection you have in your computer to the playlist of this software, and you'll get recommendation from whatever similar is present online. This will help you to get links of similar songs.

"Phew! Now I don't have to **search** new music on the Internet according to my taste!"
