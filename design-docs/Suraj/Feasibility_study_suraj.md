# Project Recommend

## Feasibility Study report

## Scope of Document

This document covers the economic and technical feasibility of **Project Recommend**

This report covers the following

- Analysis of problem (Why do we need this software)
- Limitations and constraints
- Economical feasibility of product
- Public survey to validate our assumptions


## Analysis of problem (Why do we need this software ?)

Music recommend is a fairly normal thing nowadays, we see it all over the places like YouTube, SoundCloud and all there other music provider services.
then why do we need this software

- Here is few limitations of all those online Music recommendation that we trying to overcome
recommendations as based on collaborative filtering which means you have to use that service quite a while for it's recommendation service to give reliable results

- Everything is limited to that service, means you get recommendation on what that service have you to offer.

- most of there services are paid/subscription based

- requires high internet bandwidth to stream music.

here is what we are doing to overcome those problems
we are trying to provide recommendations on your offline music collection that you have in your computer.
music that you bought as a CD or from any online music store. means we are not limited to an particular services
we use content based filtering that doesn't require any user data to work.
we only fetch metadata so we can work on low bandwidth internet connections.

## Limitations and Constraints

- Waveform Analysis

This is one of the methods we could have used to classify music. In this method, we analyze and classify
the music wave into genres such as pop, jazz etc., but there is not enough training data available to
analyze the waveform. Also there is not enough research done in this field. Hence, this method could not
be used in practical (For instance, Spotify tried it and got worst results as compared to other techniques).


- Collaborative Filtering

Here, in this method, we use user data to recommend next set of songs to the user. But, due to lack of
time and resources we do not have enough user data to make this method feasible to use. If we did have
the user data, that data would have been used by the training model to recommend new songs based on that data.


- Availability of other basic requirements

Internet is one of the basic requirements for our software to work, Lack of internet means
that our software will work like a plain music player. in lack of internet connection we can't provide recommendation but already cached recommendations will available to user with internet connection


## Economic Feasibility

This project is an open-source project, we do not have any business goals, we do not have any intentions of making profit. The software will be available to everyone for free, anyone can use our work under mentioned license and improve upon it. we also accepts patches from anyone via GitHub and merge it after review. that way anyone can contribute into development of this software.


## Conclusions From Our Survey

#### Results form our survey we did on 110 peoples belonging from different backgrounds.
These results are significant enough to show that our project is feasible
